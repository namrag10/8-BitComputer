The Board
=======

Each board should have its own power sourse




Address
=====

This board is designed to be daisychained one after the other.
This is to keep manufacturing cost low, and so I can use the free version of Eagle!

Only 13 bits are used, as the AT28C64B's only take 13bits
	> A re-design will be needed to add bits here
2^13 op codes is loads though, so heavy doubt I'll need more for a while




Signals
=====

Signal outs are from the 74xx157 selectors, so the EEPROM's can output direct
to the databus via the output 245's buffers




Decoding
======

139's can be stacked on this, and screwed in




Device I/O
=======

These are the ribbon cables to go to the modules.
Very generic, need to assign the signals outside of the PCB
